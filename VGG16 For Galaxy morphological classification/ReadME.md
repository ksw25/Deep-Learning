**Problem Statement**:<br>
In this competition you will analyze images of galaxies to determine the probability that it
belongs to particular class.<br>
More information about setting up and using TensorFlow can be found here:
https://www.tensorflow.org<br>
Your model must have at least the following:<br>
• At least two Convolutional Layers followed by normalization and pooling layers.<br>
• Activation function ReLU.<br>
• Optimizer: Gradient Descent.<br>
• At least one fully connected layer followed by softmax transformation.<br>
There are several techniques to improve the performance and generalization of the
Convolutional Neural Network. The objective is to try different methods to tweak the
performance of your model and observe how the performance changes. You may use
CNN's/ResNet/ODENet, etc.<br>
Following are a few suggestions which you may try for the purpose of this challenge:<br>
• Modify architecture :<br>
– Change number of Convolution layers<br>
– Try a different kernel size<br>
– Change number of fully connected Layers<br>
• Change the activation function<br>
• Try a different optimizer<br>
• Data Augmentation<br>
• Add dropout<br>
Your techniques need not be limited to just these. You must try at least two different
methods and document any significant observations.
